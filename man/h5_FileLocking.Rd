\title{Test and set file locking for HDF5}
\usage{
h5testFileLocking(location = NULL)

h5disableFileLocking()

h5enableFileLocking()
}
\arguments{
\item{location}{Deprecated and ignored.}
}
\value{
\code{h5testFileLocking} returns a logical scalar indicating
whether file locking is enabled.

\code{h5disableFileLocking} and \code{h5enableFileLocking} set are called
for the side effect of setting or unsetting the environment variable
\code{HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING} and do not return anything.
}
\description{
HDF5 1.14.6 uses file locking by default.  On some file systems this is not
available, and the HDF5 library will throw an error if the user attempts to
create or access a file located on such a file system. These functions allow
the locking to be disabled for the duration of the R session if needed.
}
\details{
In previous versions of \pkg{rhdf5}, \code{h5testFileLocking} created a
temporary HDF5 file and attempted to lock it in order to test the file locking
capabilities of the current system. However, newer versions of the HDF5
library no longer expose the locking functionality for this test. So,
\code{h5testFileLocking} now just consults the #' \code{HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING}
environment variable to see whether it is enabled.

\code{h5disableFileLocking} will set the environment variable
\code{HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING=FALSE}, which is the recommended was to disable
this behaviour if file locking is not supported.  This will only persist
within the current R session.  You can set the environment variable outside
of R if this is a more general issue on your system.

\code{h5enableFileLocking} will unset the \code{HDF5_USE_FILE_LOCKING}
environment variable.

More discussion of HDF5's use of file locking can be found online e.g.

\examples{

## either a file name or directory can be tested
file <- tempfile()
dir <- tempdir()

h5testFileLocking(dir)
h5testFileLocking(file)

## we can check for file locking, and disable if needed
if( !h5testFileLocking(dir) ) {
  h5disableFileLocking()
}
